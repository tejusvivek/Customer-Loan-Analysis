In this project, I transferred a comprehensive banking loans dataset from local storage to Azure SQL Database using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). The data was structured into well-organized tables in Azure SQL, ensuring efficient data management. I performed various analyses on loan performance, customer creditworthiness, and repayment trends using SQL queries, providing valuable insights to optimize lending decisions and mitigate risks. This project demonstrates proficiency in data migration, SQL database management, and financial data analysis.
